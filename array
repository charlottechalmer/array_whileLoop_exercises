Arrays:
	Can put anything in an array:
		- number, string, boolean, array, etc
	
	If we wanted to console.log:

		console.log(arr3[3]);
			---> ** count starting from zero in arrays so this would print the array within the array (the offset from the beginning of the array):

			var arr3 = ["hello", true, 3.14, ["hi", "bye"				

	var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	arr2[4] = "potato"; // this will overwrite array 2 at index 4;

	arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, "potato"];


	var myArr = ["a", "b", "c"];
	myArr.push("potato");
		//will push "potato" onto the end of the array
		console.log(myArr);
			["a", "b", "c", "potato"];
		console.log(myArr.length);
			--> will print 4 ** IS THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE ARRAY-- the count (1, 2, 3, 4) v the  (0, 1, 2, 3);

	Why arrays are better:
		"loops"-- 
				*"for loop" is shorthand for the "while loop"
		the "while loop"
			--> "Ask the user for grades until they enter something that is not a number"
				--> "sum up the grades and then divide by the number of grades"
					--> "print that as the average grade"
			--> ** while(//something) {
						//execute the following
					}
		var is_number = true;
		
		while(is_number) {
			var next_grade = prompt("Next grade");
			next_grade = parseFloat(next_grade);
		}

		--> if they put in "7", parseFloat will be 7,
		if they put in "potato", parseFloat will be NaN

		have to add:
			if(isNaN(next_grade)) {
				is_number = false;
			} else {
				grade.push(next_grade);
			}
		}

		--> have to set grade to an empty array and define it outside of the loop so it adds the grade to the array rather than starting a new array
		--> the loop stops when is_number = false
